				Hello, my name is Christina. That's me. <img src="images/profile.jpg" alt="profile"/>
			</p>
			<p>
				I'm originally from Brooklyn, New York but have lived in New Mexico for many years now. However, my
				family is originally from Mexico.

			<p>
				I recently took a trip to Mexico to visit my family <img src="images/family.jpg" alt="Family in Mexico">
				and eat some amazing food <img src="images/food.jpg" alt="Mexican Food">I was even fortunate enough to
				visit some pyramids! <img src="images/pyramidTop.jpg" alt="Top of Pyramid">
			</p>
			<p>
				When not traveling, I like to spend time with my two best friends. That's them! <img src="images/stephanie.jpg" alt="Best Friend Stephanie"> 				<img src="images/kendall.jpg" alt="Best Friend
				 Kendall">. The <em>Walking Dead</em> is my favorite show and I never miss the opportunity to watch
				with my dog, Jasmine. <img src="images/watchShows.jpg" alt="Watching show with dog"> We both get really
				into the show. For fun, I like to powerlift. I've only been doing it for a couple years, but have learned
				so much about my own strength and how to push through mental boundaries. I even competed and got this
				cool medal. <img src="images/powerlifting.jpg" alt="Powerlifting Medal">
